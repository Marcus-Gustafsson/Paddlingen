"""
File: config.py

What it does:
  - This file holds all the important settings for our Flask application.
  - It keeps configuration separate from our main application logic, which is a
    very good practice. This includes things like database location, debug modes,
    and secret keys.

Why itâ€™s here:
  - By centralizing configuration, we can easily change settings for different
    environments (like development vs. production) without changing the core
    application code.

# --- Secret Keys & Credentials ---
# These are loaded from your .env file for security.

# This tells our database library (Flask-SQLAlchemy) where to find the database.
#
# The URI can come from the ``DATABASE_URL`` environment variable.  This allows
# production deployments to point at a managed database service such as
# PostgreSQL.  A typical PostgreSQL URI looks like::
#
#     postgresql+psycopg://user:password@hostname:5432/databasename
#
# If ``DATABASE_URL`` is not defined we fall back to a SQLite file stored in the
# repository's ``instance`` directory.  SQLite requires no separate server and is

# --- Form & CSRF Protection Configuration (Flask-WTF) ---

# This globally enables CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection for all forms.
# It's a critical security feature that prevents other malicious websites from
# tricking your users into submitting data to your app without their knowledge.

# --- Session Cookie Security Settings ---
# These settings make our user login sessions more secure.

# If set to True, the browser will only send the session cookie over a secure
# HTTPS connection. This prevents the cookie from being stolen by eavesdroppers
# on an insecure network (like public Wi-Fi).
#
# We default this to True so production deployments are safe by default.
# When developing locally without HTTPS, set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=False`
# in your environment (e.g. in `.env`) to allow testing over plain HTTP.
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = _bool_from_env("SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE", default=True)

# If set to True, it tells the browser not to allow JavaScript to access the
# session cookie. This is a crucial defense against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
# attacks where an attacker might try to steal the cookie using malicious script.
SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True

# This is another modern security measure to mitigate CSRF attacks.
# 'Lax' means the cookie will be sent when a user navigates to our site from
# an external link, but not on requests initiated by third-party sites (like
# images or forms). 'Strict' is more secure but can be less user-friendly.
# 'Lax' is a great, secure default.

# --- Development Settings ---

# The DEBUG flag enables or disables Flask's debug mode.
# When True:
#   - The server will automatically reload when you change your code.
#   - It will show a detailed, interactive debugger in the browser if an error occurs.
# WARNING: This MUST be set to `False` in a production environment, as the
# interactive debugger can expose sensitive information.
#
# The setting defaults to False for safety. To enable the debugger during
# development, export `FLASK_DEBUG=True` or add it to your `.env` file.
