def get_images_for_year(year: str) -> list[str]:
    """
    Return a random subset of image filenames from the given year's folder.

    This function:
      1. Looks inside 'static/images/<year>/' for files.
      2. Filters to only common image extensions.
      3. Shuffles the list randomly on each call.
      4. Returns up to 27 filenames, but never more than two rows of 9:
         - If fewer than 18 images total, returns up to 9.
         - If between 18 and 26 images, returns up to 18.
         - Otherwise returns exactly 27.

    Args:
        year (str): Folder name under static/images (e.g. "2024" or "2019_&_tidigare").

    Returns:
        list[str]: List of image filenames (not full paths), ready for
